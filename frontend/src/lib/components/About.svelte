  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I’ve always loved being the “translator” between tech and people. With IIoT,
    that means helping manufacturing teams turn complex systems into useful,
    actionable insight.

  <p>
    I’ve spent 10+ years as a Web and Software Developer, building solutions
    that accelerate engagement and productivity. What excites me most is
    connecting cutting-edge technology to real-world outcomes.
